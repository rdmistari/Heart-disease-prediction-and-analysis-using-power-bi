    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "There is a **positive trend** between age and resting blood pressure.  \n",
    "As age increases, resting blood pressure also tends to increase, which raises heart disease risk.\n",

    "The visualizations clearly highlight important patterns related to heart disease.  \n",
    "Age, gender, and resting blood pressure play a significant role in disease occurrence, while data imbalance and feature overlap limit predictive performance.\n",
