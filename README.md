Heart disease prediction and analysis using power bi

Project Description:- 

This project focuses on analyzing patient health data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease. Using Power BI, the project provides interactive dashboards and visual insights that help in understanding how attributes like age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors influence heart disease prediction.

Objective:-

To analyze heart disease data and identify key indicators,
To visualize trends and patterns using Power BI dashboards,
To support data-driven decision making in healthcare analysis,

Dataset Information:-

The dataset contains medical attributes such as: -
Age,
Sex,
Chest pain type,
Resting blood pressure,
Cholesterol level,
Fasting blood sugar,
Maximum heart rate,
Exercise-induced angina,
Target (presence or absence of heart disease)

Tools & Technologies Used:-

Power BI
Microsoft Excel / CSV Dataset,
Data Cleaning and Transformation (Power Query),
DAX for calculated measures

Key Features:-

Interactive dashboards with filters and slicers,
Visual comparison of heart disease across age groups and gender,
Analysis of major risk factors,
Easy-to-understand charts and KPIs

Steps Involved:-

Data collection and loading into Power BI,
Data cleaning and preprocessing,
Data modeling and relationship creation,
Dashboard and report creation,
Insight generation and analysis

Dashboard Insights:-

Higher risk observed in certain age groups,
Gender-based comparison of heart disease cases,
Impact of cholesterol and blood pressure on heart disease,
Relationship between exercise and heart health

Conclusion:-
The project demonstrates how Power BI can be effectively used to analyze healthcare data and predict heart disease trends. The visual insights help in identifying critical risk factors and can assist healthcare professionals and analysts in making informed decisions.

Future Enhancements:-

Integration with machine learning models for prediction,
Real-time data updates,
More detailed patient segmentation.
